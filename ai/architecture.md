# pg_fusion Architecture Overview

The active PostgreSQL extension is `pg/extension` (`pg_fusion`). It
hooks PostgreSQL planning/execution and delegates selected query work to an
in-process DataFusion worker runtime through shared-memory control rings and
page-backed Arrow batches.

## Top-Level Runtime Path

- `pg/extension/`: pgrx host extension, GUCs, planner/custom-scan hooks,
  shared-memory bootstrap, and background worker entrypoint.
- `pg/backend_service/`: backend execution state, scan coordination, and
  PostgreSQL slot-scan page production.
- `worker_runtime/`: worker-side DataFusion runtime, physical scan integration,
  and result page production.
- `runtime_protocol/`: typed backend/worker control-plane messages.
- `control_transport/`: shared-memory control rings and backend/worker leases.
- `runtime_filter`: shared-memory friendly runtime filters. The Bloom bitset
  layer is separate from the shared-memory pool/lifecycle layer: builders
  acquire an exclusive generation before clearing/inserting, publish `Ready`
  with a CAS, and probes only reject rows for a matching ready generation.
  Stale or in-progress generations pass rows unfiltered. Pool slots use
  reference counts so ready storage is reused only after the owner and all
  probes have exited, preserving the no-false-negative property.
- `page/pool`, `page/transfer`, `page/issuance`: fixed-page ownership,
  transfer, and issued-frame flow.
- `runtime_metrics`: shared-memory runtime counters and page-slot handoff
  stamps exposed through SQL.
- `page/arrow_layout`, `page/row_encoder`, `page/import`,
  `pg/slot_encoder`, `pg/slot_import`: page-backed Arrow layout,
  PostgreSQL-free row-to-page encoding, PostgreSQL slot adaptation, and result
  projection.
- `pg/df_catalog`, `pg/plan_builder`, `pg/scan_node`, `pg/scan_sql`,
  `pg/slot_scan`: backend-side DataFusion planning and trusted PostgreSQL scan
  SQL execution.
- `pg/df_functions`: PostgreSQL-compatible DataFusion function overrides used
  by both backend planning and worker/codec decoding. Its `avg` UDAF returns
  `Float64` for `float4`/`float8` inputs with PostgreSQL-facing
  `NaN`/`Infinity` and finite-overflow behavior, while integer and finite
  Decimal128 averages use the fast Arrow `Decimal128(38,16)` result path. That
  decimal path is intentionally a pragmatic `numeric` subset with documented
  precision/display-scale limitations, and all `avg` accumulators implement
  inverse transitions so bounded/sliding window frames can retract rows during
  DataFusion window execution.
- `pg/statistics`: PostgreSQL planner/catalog statistics bridge. It is
  PostgreSQL-specific but independent of DataFusion and `join_order`;
  `plan_builder` uses it to turn pushed-down scan SQL, `pg_class`,
  `pg_statistic`, and unique indexes into compact relation/join estimates. It
  reports only relation-wide unique keys; partial unique indexes are skipped
  until predicate implication is modeled explicitly.
- `join_order`: standalone compact join-order optimizer core. It has no
  DataFusion or PostgreSQL dependency; `plan_builder` provides filtered
  relation statistics, join edges, and opaque predicate handles.

## Data Path

1. Backend planning first keeps PostgreSQL-owned service paths out of
   `pg_fusion`: the planner hook bypasses DataFusion planning for queries with
   bind parameters, relations in `pg_catalog`/TOAST namespaces, or
   function/table-function range entries produced by PostgreSQL rewrite, then
   deparses wrapper query strings such as `EXPLAIN` and `COPY (SELECT ...)` back
   to the inner `Query` text so PostgreSQL can keep native wrapper execution
   around a pg_fusion custom scan. Eligible user query text is parsed with
   sqlparser's PostgreSQL dialect before DataFusion planning, which accepts more
   PostgreSQL surface syntax but does not make unsupported PostgreSQL semantics
   executable. It then resolves PostgreSQL catalog metadata
   for eligible user queries, runs DataFusion logical optimization, then uses
   `pg_statistics` plus `join_order` to reorder
   eligible inner/cross join components before scan lowering. The reorder pass
   estimates each PostgreSQL leaf from the same pushed-down scan SQL that will
   later become a scan descriptor, maps join columns back to PostgreSQL attnums,
   and uses NDV/null fractions plus relation-wide unique keys for equi-join
   selectivity. The `join_order` solution also chooses the hash build side for
   each binary join; `plan_builder` emits that side as the DataFusion left
   child because `CollectLeft` hash joins build the left input, then restores
   the original visible output order with a projection when needed. Ineligible
   join shapes keep their DataFusion order. PostgreSQL-compatible function
   overrides are registered before SQL planning, logical optimization, plan
   codec decoding, worker physical planning, and EXPLAIN physical planning; in
   particular `float4`/`float8` `avg` keeps float semantics, while integer and
   finite Decimal128 `avg` are planned as `Decimal128(38,16)` aggregates end to
   end. PostgreSQL `numeric` `NaN`/`Infinity` constants and literal numeric
   casts are rejected before they can enter Arrow Decimal128 execution, and
   accepted decimal formatting/precision differences live in
   `pg/extension/pg_compat/limitations.sql`. Scan leaves are then lowered to
   `PgScanNode`/`scan_sql` descriptors. Non-recursive CTEs
   referenced more than once are planned as `PgCteRefNode` reads over a single
   lowered CTE producer so worker execution materializes the CTE once and
   reuses the owned batches. PostgreSQL text-like columns are represented as
   Arrow `Utf8View` in the DataFusion logical schema so scan pages can stay
   zero-copy for string payloads.
2. Worker physical planning attaches runtime Bloom filters to eligible
   `HashJoinExec` nodes unless `pg_fusion.runtime_filter_enable` is disabled.
   The v1 path is intentionally narrow: one `Inner` hash join equi-key, `Column =
   Column`, single-partition build side, supported key type (`bool`,
   `int2`/`int4`/`int8`, `float4`/`float8`, or text-like `Utf8View` from
   `text`/`varchar`/`bpchar`/`name`), and a `WorkerPgScanExec` on the probe
   side. The worker registers the target by `(session_epoch,
   scan_id, output_column)` in shared memory, fills the filter while consuming
   the build side, and publishes it when that stream reaches EOF. If the pool
   is full the join runs unchanged and increments a diagnostic counter.
3. Worker DataFusion execution opens scans through the runtime protocol.
4. Backend executes trusted scan SQL through `slot_scan`, drains PostgreSQL
   executor slots with a custom `DestReceiver` and explicit fetch row budgets,
   optionally applies attached runtime filters before slot-to-Arrow encoding,
   encodes surviving `TupleTableSlot` rows into initialized `arrow_layout`
   pages with `slot_encoder`, and sends issued pages to the worker. The filter
   key is deformed once and the same deformed slot is then reused by
   `slot_encoder`. Each scan always has a
   leader backend producer. PostgreSQL `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` is a
   query-wide budget for additional dynamic background-worker producers across
   eligible heap scans, capped at `32` and bounded by `max_worker_processes`;
   each producer owns a dedicated scan control slot and writes its own Arrow
   pages into shared memory.
5. Worker imports scan pages as Arrow `RecordBatch` values, runs DataFusion
   operators under its current-thread Tokio runtime, writes Arrow result pages,
   and sends issued frames back. Zero-row plans whose DataFusion stream has an
   empty schema, such as `EmptyExec`, use a close-only result path with no Arrow
   pages. Row-count-only PostgreSQL scans use dummy SQL projection in
   PostgreSQL but transfer non-empty empty-schema Arrow pages; these scans stay
   leader-only because dynamic scan workers require projected base-relation
   columns. Scan production remains on PostgreSQL backend/scan-worker threads;
   Tokio only drives DataFusion planning, multi-partition root collection, and
   result-stream polling.
6. Backend imports result pages with `slot_import` and projects rows into
   PostgreSQL tuple slots. Result transport supports Decimal128 fixed-width
   pages for PostgreSQL `numeric` outputs produced by worker-side expressions;
   backend heap scans still do not encode arbitrary PostgreSQL `numeric`
   columns through `slot_encoder`.

Page-backed scan batches stay zero-copy through streaming DataFusion operators.
After physical planning, `scan_node` inserts `PageMaterializeExec` only before
operators that can retain input batches beyond immediate streaming, such as
sort/window operators and join build sides. The wrapper copies Arrow arrays into
ordinary allocations at that boundary so shared-memory pages and permits can be
released while preserving zero-copy for simple scans, filters, projections,
limits, and plain aggregates. Multi-use CTE materialization is another owned
boundary: `CteScanExec` deep-copies the producer output once before replaying it
to multiple consumers.

Runtime metrics live in a separate shared-memory region. The runtime does not
wrap control rings for v1 metrics; scan/result page senders stamp page
descriptors, and receivers use those stamps to measure backend-to-worker and
worker-to-backend page handoff latency. Worker scan threads also split
backend-to-worker latency into idle sleeps, page import, and DataFusion scan
channel send/delivery time. Detailed scan timing is opt-in through
`pg_fusion.scan_timing_detail`; it splits backend scan page fill time with
coarse page/fetch timers. Slot-to-Arrow serialization internals are left to
external profilers. Runtime filter counters track allocated/ready filters,
pool exhaustion, build rows, probe rows, rejected rows, and rows that passed
unfiltered because the filter was not ready for that probe.

Dynamic scan workers use CTID block-range chunking as the first parallel scan
strategy. The leader backend scans one heap block range, additional dynamic
background workers scan disjoint ranges, and `worker_runtime` fans all producer
streams into one logical `PgScanExec`. The query-wide worker budget is assigned
before execution starts; if PostgreSQL cannot launch more dynamic workers at
runtime, pg_fusion cancels any partially launched producers for that scan and
continues leader-only for that and later scans. Each producer has its own
ordered issued-page receive stream because producer-local page transfer ids
start at `1`. Relations with dropped attributes or unsupported scan shapes stay
on leader-only portal streaming. Dynamic scan worker jobs carry a resolved
standalone scan descriptor for one PostgreSQL leaf scan rather than the original
user SQL, so worker startup does not depend on backend-local `search_path` or
repeat full DataFusion planning. `EXPLAIN` uses the same eligibility and budget
logic to show planned producer counts for every PostgreSQL scan leaf; `EXPLAIN
ANALYZE` also reports the producer channels installed for the real execution.

## Retired Legacy Stack

The old raw-heap-page stack has been retired from the workspace: `executor`,
`scan`, `storage`, `protocol`, and `common` are no longer active crates. The
active extension crate now lives at `pg/extension`. `lockfree` remains active
because it underpins the new transport/page stack.
