# Component: slot_encoder

- `slot_encoder` adapts PostgreSQL `TupleTableSlot` rows into typed cells for
  `page/row_encoder`, which writes directly into an initialized
  `arrow_layout` block.
- The hot page-writing core is PostgreSQL-free and benchmarked through
  `cargo bench -p row_encoder --bench q05_encode`.
- `slot_encoder` does not depend on `import`, `transfer`, `storage`, or
  DataFusion.
- Public boundary in v1:
  - caller plans and initializes a block externally through `arrow_layout`
  - `PageBatchEncoder::new(tuple_desc, payload)` validates the block against the
    PostgreSQL `TupleDesc`
  - `unsafe append_slot(slot)` deforms/detoasts PostgreSQL values, forwards
    typed cells to `row_encoder`, and returns `AppendStatus::{Appended, Full}`;
    the caller must provide a live backend-local `TupleTableSlot`
  - `finish()` writes final header state and returns `{ row_count, payload_len }`
- Hot-path details:
  - `row_encoder` writes fixed-width values, validity bits, `ByteView` slots,
    and long view payload bytes directly into the target block
  - local `row_count` and tail cursor are staged in the row encoder and flushed
    back to the block header at `finish()`
  - `append_slot` uses a slot-specific fast path over `tts_values` / `tts_isnull`
  - executor slots may carry an equivalent but different `TupleDesc` pointer;
    the encoder validates structural compatibility once per page before using
    its planned output descriptor for type-specific writes
  - projected encoding distinguishes identity projection from an explicit empty
    projection; `new_projected(..., &[])` consumes rows from a dummy PostgreSQL
    tuple descriptor and writes empty-schema pages with a non-zero row count
  - it calls the slot-specific `tts_ops->getsomeattrs` function directly when
    the slot is not yet sufficiently deformed, then preserves PostgreSQL's
    missing-attribute fallback through `slot_getmissingattrs`
  - projected non-null fixed-width `int2/int4/int8/float4/float8` batches use a
    row encoder fast path that avoids per-cell closure dispatch and validity
    writes
  - projected text-like and binary varlena values may be detoasted through
    `pg_detoast_datum_packed` before `row_encoder` sees borrowed bytes
  - packed `varlena` parsing depends on PostgreSQL `varatt.h` header macros (`VARATT_IS_1B`, `VARATT_IS_1B_E`, `VARATT_IS_4B_C`, `VARSIZE_1B`, `VARSIZE_4B`)
  - when upgrading to a new PostgreSQL major, re-check those `varatt.h` macros against the Rust parser before trusting the existing bit layout assumptions
- Supported v1 type surface:
  - `bool`
  - `int2/int4/int8`
  - `float4/float8`
  - `text/varchar/bpchar/name -> Arrow Utf8View`
  - `bytea -> Arrow BinaryView`
  - `uuid -> Arrow FixedSizeBinary(16)`
  - finite `numeric(p,s) -> Arrow Decimal128(p,s)` for `p <= 38` and
    `0 <= s <= p`
  - finite bare `numeric -> Arrow Decimal128(38,16)`; values outside that fixed
    shape and PostgreSQL `numeric` `NaN`/`Infinity` fail during scan encoding
  - finite `interval -> Arrow Interval(MonthDayNano)`; PostgreSQL interval
    infinities are rejected because Arrow has no interval special values
- Output contract:
  - caller-provided payload already contains one initialized `arrow_layout` block
  - `payload_len` currently equals the block size published by `arrow_layout`
  - `AppendStatus::Full` means the current row did not fit and must be retried on a fresh block
