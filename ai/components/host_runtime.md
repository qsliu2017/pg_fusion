# Component: Host Runtime

- `pg/extension` is the active pgrx extension crate.
- Backend control uses `protocol` messages over `control_transport`.
- Backend scan production uses PostgreSQL `slot_scan` plus `slot_encoder` to
  stream Arrow layout pages to the worker.
- Backend-to-worker scan control ring `Full` is scan-stream backpressure. The
  host keeps unsent scan pages and terminal scan frames pending and retries the
  same frame later; `IssuedOutboundPage::mark_sent()` only follows successful
  carrier delivery.
- PostgreSQL `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` controls the query-wide dynamic
  background-worker scan producer budget for eligible heap scans. Each scan
  always has a leader backend producer; positive budget is shared across scans,
  capped at `32`, and bounded by `max_worker_processes`. Each producer owns a
  dedicated scan slot and writes pages directly to the shared page pool; the
  worker fan-ins all producers for the same `scan_id` with a separate
  issued-page receiver per producer stream. Scan worker jobs carry standalone
  scan descriptors built from resolved `PgScanSpec` values instead of the
  original user SQL, avoiding `search_path` dependence in dynamic background
  workers. Dynamic worker capacity failures clean up partial launches and
  continue leader-only for the current and remaining scans; readiness/protocol
  failures still fail the query.
- The primary worker owns a current-thread Tokio runtime for DataFusion
  physical planning and result-stream execution. Root physical plans are driven
  through DataFusion `execute_stream`, so multi-partition roots such as `UNION`
  are collected by DataFusion rather than by manually executing only partition
  `0`. PostgreSQL scan producers remain ordinary backend/scan-worker threads:
  they communicate through shared-memory scan transport and never call
  PostgreSQL APIs from Tokio tasks.
- Worker-side DataFusion spill is opt-in through Postmaster GUC
  `pg_fusion.worker_memory_limit_mb`. `0` preserves the default unbounded
  DataFusion runtime; positive values use a finite `FairSpillPool` and
  per-execution OS temp directories under a cluster-scoped worker spill root.
  The primary worker marks owned worker-incarnation directories, removes stale
  marked directories in the same cluster namespace on startup, and removes
  execution directories on success, failure, or cancel. Disabled spill does not
  create directories or run spill garbage collection. This is not PostgreSQL
  `BufFile` storage and does not honor `temp_tablespaces`, `temp_file_limit`,
  or ResourceOwner cleanup.
- Worker execution lives in `runtime/worker` and consumes scan pages as Arrow
  batches through `page/import`. Transport scan streams use a bounded
  DataFusion batch channel and short idle polling interval so scan threads can
  absorb minor downstream polling gaps without sleeping for millisecond-scale
  page handoff latency. The defaults are `32` batches and `50us`; the backend
  captures `pg_fusion.scan_batch_channel_capacity` and
  `pg_fusion.scan_idle_poll_interval_us` at query start and passes them to the
  worker through `StartExecution`. Scan transport normalization allows empty
  schemas so dummy-projection scans can pass row counts as zero-column batches;
  result-page transport still rejects non-empty empty-schema result batches.
- Runtime Bloom filters are controlled by `pg_fusion.runtime_filter_enable`
  (default `on`) plus postmaster-sized pool settings
  `pg_fusion.runtime_filter_count`, `pg_fusion.runtime_filter_bits`, and
  `pg_fusion.runtime_filter_hashes`. Worker physical planning allocates filters
  from a shared-memory pool and records `(session_epoch, scan_id,
  output_column, key_type)` metadata there. Backend scan producers, including
  dynamic standalone scan workers, attach probes by `(session_epoch, scan_id)`
  at scan open and test supported bool, integer, float, and text-like keys
  before Arrow encoding. No control-ring message is needed for readiness;
  probes read the shared lifecycle word and pass rows unfiltered until the
  matching generation is `Ready`.
- Results return as issued Arrow pages and are projected into PostgreSQL tuple
  slots through `pg/slot_import`.
- The issuance permit pool is sized from `pg_fusion.page_count`; there is no
  separate host GUC for permit count.
- Runtime metrics are global shared-memory counters exposed by
  `pg_fusion_metrics()` and reset by `pg_fusion_metrics_reset()`. Page handoff
  latency is measured with page descriptor stamps, not by instrumenting ring
  internals. Worker scan-thread metrics additionally split scan page handoff
  into idle sleep time, page read/import time, `tx.send(Ok(batch))` time, and
  frame-read-to-DataFusion-batch-delivery time. Runtime filter metrics count
  allocations, ready publications, pool exhaustion, build rows, probed rows,
  rejected rows, and probe rows that passed unfiltered because a filter was not
  ready.
- Backend scan timing is always on and intentionally coarse: `scan_page_fill_ns`
  covers successful emitted page fills, with cheap prepare/finish buckets and a
  retry counter. It does not instrument slot-to-Arrow internals; use external
  flamegraphs for deformation, detoast, and page-write attribution.
- The fast backend scan receiver keeps the Rust row callback monomorphized
  through `slot_scan`; the unavoidable indirect boundary is PostgreSQL's
  `DestReceiver.receiveSlot` function pointer.
- `EXPLAIN` stays backend-local: `backend_service` lowers the planned query to
  a DataFusion physical plan, renders PostgreSQL scan leaves with present
  soft-limit/local-row-cap metadata, and prints the nested multiline
  `slot_scan` plan directly below the leaf. `EXPLAIN VERBOSE` also includes the
  compiled scan SQL but omits internal scan ids, table oids, planner fetch
  hints, and raw Arrow schema debug dumps. Scan leaves also render pg_fusion's
  planned dynamic scan producers and, for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, the producer set
  installed during execution.
- The retired raw heap page stack (`executor`, `scan`, `storage`, `protocol`,
  `common`) is no longer part of the workspace.
