# metrics

`metrics` stores low-overhead runtime counters, timers, and page handoff
stamps for the active `pg_fusion` runtime. The crate is intentionally small and
has no PostgreSQL dependency: the extension allocates one shared-memory region,
initializes it during `_PG_init`, then passes cheap `RuntimeMetrics` handles to
the backend and worker code paths.

The crate does not instrument control rings directly. Page senders stamp the
`PageDescriptor` when an issued page is published, and receivers measure the
elapsed monotonic time when that descriptor arrives. This keeps the first version
focused on the data-plane delays that matter for scan/result latency without
wrapping every transport operation.

Worker scan threads also record the local delivery path after a backend page is
visible: idle polling sleeps, page import, and the blocking send into
DataFusion's scan channel. These timers help distinguish backend-to-worker page
handoff from DataFusion-side backpressure.

## Region Lifecycle

Use `RuntimeMetricsConfig` to size the shared region. `page_count` must match the
page pool, because the crate stores one page stamp per page id.

```rust
use std::ptr::NonNull;
use metrics::{RuntimeMetrics, RuntimeMetricsConfig};

let config = RuntimeMetricsConfig::new(page_count)?;
let layout = RuntimeMetrics::layout(config)?;

// Allocate `layout.size` bytes with `layout.align` alignment in shared memory.
let base: NonNull<u8> = shmem_base;

// Postmaster initialization path.
let metrics = unsafe { RuntimeMetrics::init_in_place(base, layout.size, config)? };

// Backend/worker attach path.
let metrics = unsafe { RuntimeMetrics::attach(base, layout.size)? };
```

`RuntimeMetrics::default()` is a no-op handle. It is useful in tests and in
runtime code that can run outside the PostgreSQL extension.

## Recording Values

Counters and timers are updated with relaxed atomics and saturating arithmetic.
The values are cumulative until `reset()` is called.

```rust
use metrics::{MetricId, PageDirection};

metrics.increment(MetricId::BackendExecCallsTotal);

let start = metrics.now_ns();
do_backend_work();
metrics.add_elapsed(MetricId::BackendTotalNs, start);

metrics.stamp_page(PageDirection::BackendToWorker, descriptor, payload_len);
if let Some(observation) = metrics.observe_page(PageDirection::BackendToWorker, descriptor) {
    metrics.add(MetricId::ScanB2wWaitNs, observation.wait_ns);
    metrics.increment(MetricId::ScanB2wWaitTotal);
}
```

`reset()` clears all metric values, clears page stamps, and advances
`reset_epoch`. Receivers ignore stamps from older epochs. Reset is intended for
manual experiments; concurrent increments can race with a reset and are not a
transactional snapshot boundary.

## Reading Values

The crate exposes raw `MetricValue` rows through `snapshot()`. The extension maps
those rows to SQL via `pg_fusion_metrics()`:

```sql
SELECT component, metric, kind, unit, value, reset_epoch
FROM pg_fusion_metrics()
ORDER BY component, metric;
```

Naming conventions:

- `*_ns` is accumulated monotonic time in nanoseconds.
- `*_total` is an event count or cumulative counter.
- `*_bytes_sent_total` is payload bytes written into shared page slots.

Timer totals can overlap. For example, `backend_total_ns` and `worker_total_ns`
often cover the same wall-clock interval from different processes, so their sum
is not expected to equal `query_total_ns`.

To derive averages, divide a timer by its matching count:

```sql
SELECT
  sum(value) FILTER (WHERE metric = 'scan_b2w_wait_ns')::numeric
  / nullif(sum(value) FILTER (WHERE metric = 'scan_b2w_wait_total'), 0)
    AS avg_scan_backend_to_worker_wait_ns
FROM pg_fusion_metrics();
```

## Scan Timing

`scan_page_fill_ns` is a coarse backend timer. It includes PostgreSQL cursor
execution, callback dispatch, slot deform/detoast, Arrow writes, page
initialization, and page finalization. The published scan timers are cheap
enough to remain always enabled:

```sql
SELECT pg_fusion_metrics_reset();

SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE a = 1;

SELECT metric, value
FROM pg_fusion_metrics()
WHERE metric LIKE 'scan_%'
ORDER BY metric;
```

Scan timing intentionally stays at page/fetch boundaries. It does not
instrument slot-to-Arrow internals; use an external flamegraph/profiler for
deformation, detoast, and page-write attribution.

Interpretation:

- `scan_page_fill_ns` includes PostgreSQL executor/heap/filter work, receiver
  callback work, Arrow writes, page layout, and estimator work for emitted scan
  pages.
- `scan_page_prepare_ns` and `scan_page_finish_ns` split the cheap page
  setup/finalize portions of successful scan page emission.
- `scan_page_retry_total` counts estimator retry/backoff attempts that did not
  emit a page.

## Interpreting Common Patterns

If `scan_page_fill_ns` dominates and `scan_pages_sent_total` is small, the
backend is likely spending most latency inside PostgreSQL scanning and page
encoding before the worker receives data. A selective query without an exact
limit can still need to scan to EOF before emitting a partial page.

If `scan_eof_pages_total` is positive and `scan_full_pages_total` is zero, scan
pages are reaching the worker only after PostgreSQL exhausts the cursor. For a
highly selective query this can explain high latency even when only one row is
returned.

Scan page timing intentionally stops at coarse emitted-page buckets. Use
external profilers when you need slot deformation, detoast, or page-write
attribution inside `scan_page_fill_ns`.

If `scan_b2w_wait_ns` or `result_w2b_wait_ns` dominates, the page has already
been produced and the delay is in data-plane handoff or receiver scheduling.

If `scan_b2w_wait_ns` is high but `scan_batch_send_ns` is low, the worker scan
thread is not reading frames promptly. Check `scan_idle_sleep_ns` and scheduler
or producer wakeup behavior. If `scan_batch_send_ns` is high, the worker scan
thread is blocked handing batches to DataFusion, usually because the downstream
physical plan is not polling that scan stream fast enough.

`scan_batch_delivery_ns` should be read with `scan_page_read_ns` and
`scan_batch_send_ns`: delivery minus send approximates worker-local frame
decode/import overhead, while send isolates DataFusion channel backpressure.

If `worker_total_ns` is high but `worker_result_page_fill_ns` and physical
planning are low, the worker may mostly be waiting on scan input. Compare it
with `scan_page_fill_ns` before treating it as worker CPU time.
