# slot_encoder

`slot_encoder` adapts PostgreSQL `TupleTableSlot` rows into typed cells and
writes them into an initialized `arrow_layout` block through `row_encoder`.

It is intentionally narrow:

- producer-side only
- direct page writes into a caller-provided mutable block through
  `page/row_encoder`
- slot-only API over PostgreSQL `TupleTableSlot`
- no dependency on `import`, `transfer`, `storage`, or DataFusion

The main API shape is:

- initialize a raw block externally with `arrow_layout`
- create a `PageBatchEncoder` over that mutable block and a PostgreSQL `TupleDesc`
- append rows from `TupleTableSlot`
- finalize the block and return `row_count` plus the written payload length

The encoder does not maintain Rust heap-backed column state. PostgreSQL-specific
work is limited to slot deformation, `TupleDesc` validation, projection mapping,
and varlena detoasting. Fixed-size values, validity bits, `ByteView` slots, and
long view payloads are written directly into the target page by `row_encoder` as
rows are appended.

The output format is the same same-host shared-memory `arrow_layout` contract:

- fixed-width numeric values are written in native-endian form
- producer and consumer are expected to run on the same machine and architecture
- the pages are not intended to be a portable cross-endian wire/storage format

The current type surface is:

- `bool`
- `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
- `float32`, `float64`
- `uuid`
- `Utf8View`
- `BinaryView`

For text-like columns, the direct path requires PostgreSQL server encoding
`UTF8`. `TupleTableSlot` input may contain toasted/compressed `text` and `bytea`;
those values are detoasted through PostgreSQL and copied directly into the block
without Rust heap staging.

## Typical usage

The crate expects the caller to allocate and initialize the target block with
`arrow_layout`, then stream slots into it:

```rust,ignore
use arrow_layout::{BlockRef, LayoutPlan, init_block};
use slot_encoder::{AppendStatus, PageBatchEncoder};

let plan = LayoutPlan::from_arrow_schema(&schema, rows_per_page, payload_capacity)?;
let mut payload = vec![0u8; plan.block_size()];
init_block(&mut payload, &plan)?;

let mut encoder = unsafe { PageBatchEncoder::new(tuple_desc, &mut payload)? };
loop {
    match encoder.append_slot(slot)? {
        AppendStatus::Appended => {
            // Slot was written into the current block.
        }
        AppendStatus::Full => {
            let batch = encoder.finish()?;
            // Emit or transport `payload[..batch.payload_len]`, then start a new block.
            break;
        }
    }
}

let batch = encoder.finish()?;
assert!(batch.row_count > 0);
```

In a real producer, `slot` usually comes from a scan or executor node and the
caller creates a fresh block whenever `AppendStatus::Full` is returned.

## API summary

- `PageBatchEncoder::new(tuple_desc, payload)` validates that the initialized
  block matches the PostgreSQL `TupleDesc`.
- `PageBatchEncoder::new_projected(tuple_desc, source_columns, payload)` writes
  the same output block shape while reading values from selected source slot
  attributes. An explicitly empty `source_columns` slice is distinct from
  identity projection and writes empty-schema pages with row counts.
- `append_slot(slot)` accepts undeformed or partially deformed slots and asks
  PostgreSQL to deform enough attributes when needed.
- `with_filter_key(slot, source_index, key_type, callback)` reads one supported
  runtime-filter key from a deformed slot without staging text-like values on
  the Rust heap. Borrowed text bytes are valid only inside the callback.
- `finish()` writes final header state back into the block and returns
  `EncodedBatch { row_count, payload_len }`.

## Constraints

- The block must already be initialized by `arrow_layout`.
- The `TupleDesc` and appended slots must match the target layout, or the
  supplied projection must map every output column to a compatible source
  attribute. Empty projected layouts are allowed for row-count-only scans.
- Dropped PostgreSQL attributes are rejected when projected.
- `Utf8View` columns require a UTF-8 PostgreSQL server encoding.
- `AppendStatus::Full` means the current row did not fit and must be retried on a
  fresh block.
