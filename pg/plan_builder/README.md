# plan_builder

`plan_builder` builds backend-side DataFusion logical plans whose PostgreSQL
table leaves are built as `scan_node::PgScanNode`.

The crate is intentionally a planning bridge:

- input is SQL text plus positional DataFusion `ScalarValue` params
- relation metadata comes from `df_catalog`
- pushdown SQL is compiled by `scan_sql`
- PostgreSQL scan leaves are represented by `scan_node::PgScanSpec`
- eligible inner/cross join components are reordered with PostgreSQL
  statistics through `pg_statistics` and the standalone `join_order` optimizer
- non-recursive CTEs referenced more than once are built through
  `scan_node::PgCteRefNode` so the worker can materialize them once and reuse
  the same batches
- snapshot ownership, plan serialization, backend scan serving, and page
  transport are left to later layers
- subquery expressions are accepted when DataFusion optimization rewrites them
  into ordinary relational operators above PostgreSQL scan leaves

The output logical plan is the future `plan_codec` serialization target. It is
self-contained enough to carry the compiled scan SQL, relation identity,
`scan_id`, `table_oid`, and fetch hints, but it does not contain snapshot ids.

## Execution Contract

`PlanBuilder` performs DataFusion logical optimization with
`target_partitions = 1` in v1. This avoids inventing DataFusion-level
multi-partition semantics for one PostgreSQL scan id. It does not disable
PostgreSQL-side parallel planning: `slot_scan` can still prepare and run a
PostgreSQL plan that contains `Gather` or other PostgreSQL parallel scan nodes.

Filter pushdown is deliberately two-stage. The planning `TableSource` reports
filters as exactly pushable so DataFusion attaches them to `TableScan`. During
scan building, `scan_sql` recompiles those filters and returns any unsupported
predicates as residual filters. `plan_builder` restores those residual
predicates above `PgScanNode` and projects away residual-only columns if needed.

Subquery expressions are validated after DataFusion logical optimization. If
DataFusion decorrelates or rewrites them into joins, aggregates, projections,
and filters, `plan_builder` can build the remaining table leaves normally.
Residual `EXISTS (...)`, `IN (SELECT ...)`, scalar subqueries,
`LogicalPlan::Subquery`, or correlated `OuterReferenceColumn` nodes are still
rejected before scan building so the later `plan_codec` contract only needs to
round-trip ordinary relational operators plus PostgreSQL leaf scans.

DataFusion normally clones CTE plans at every reference. Before calling
`SqlToRel`, `plan_builder` rewrites multi-use CTE definitions to synthetic
planning table sources and plans the original CTE body separately. During scan
building, each synthetic source becomes a `PgCteRefNode` with the built CTE
definition as its child. This preserves PostgreSQL-style "compute once, read
many" behavior for floating aggregates and other non-bit-stable computations.

## Join Ordering

`PlanBuilderConfig::join_reordering_enabled` is on by default. After the normal
DataFusion logical optimization and subquery validation pass, `plan_builder`
searches for maximal reorderable join components and replaces them with a
costed tree from `join_order`.

A component is reorderable only when all of these are true:

- joins are `INNER` joins with `ON` predicates or cross joins
- there is no residual join filter and `null_equals_null` is false
- leaves are PostgreSQL planning table scans, optionally wrapped in
  `SubqueryAlias`
- transparent column-only projections may sit above the join component
- join predicates are simple equi-column pairs that can be mapped back to
  PostgreSQL attnums

For each leaf, the reordering pass recompiles the same pushed-down scan SQL that
will later become `PgScanSpec`, asks `pg_statistics::estimate_scan_sql` for
filtered rows/bytes, loads column NDV/null stats for join columns, and loads
relation-wide unique keys. Equi-join selectivity is estimated from NDV/null
fractions and clamped when the join columns cover a unique key. Partial unique
indexes are deliberately ignored by `pg_statistics`, because they are not
relation-wide keys unless predicate implication is modeled.

The `join_order` solution also carries the preferred hash build side for every
binary join. When rebuilding DataFusion logical joins, `plan_builder` orients
that build side as the left child because DataFusion's `CollectLeft` hash join
mode builds the left input. If this changes the visible column order,
`plan_builder` restores the original output schema with a projection.

The pass is intentionally conservative: unsupported join shapes are left
unchanged, while statistics/optimizer errors are returned as planning errors
when join reordering is explicitly enabled. The extension exposes this through
`pg_fusion.join_reordering`, so runtime comparisons can use:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.join_reordering = off;
```

## Example

```rust,ignore
use datafusion_common::ScalarValue;
use plan_builder::{PlanBuildInput, PlanBuilder};

let builder = PlanBuilder::new();
let built = builder.build(PlanBuildInput {
    sql: "SELECT id, payload FROM public.orders WHERE id > $1 LIMIT 32",
    params: vec![ScalarValue::Int64(Some(10))],
})?;

for scan in &built.scans {
    println!(
        "scan {} table_oid={} sql={}",
        scan.scan_id.get(),
        scan.table_oid,
        scan.compiled_scan.sql,
    );
}
```

Worker-side physical planning later installs `scan_node::PgScanExtensionPlanner`
and provides a runtime-specific execution factory for the scan specs.
