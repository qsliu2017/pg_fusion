# pg_fusion

pg_fusion is a PostgreSQL extension that delegates selected query execution to an
in-process Apache DataFusion worker runtime. The active extension crate is
`pg/extension` (`pg_fusion`).

The current runtime boundary keeps PostgreSQL responsible for catalog lookup,
planning integration, snapshots, table access, and slot materialization. Backend
scan rows are encoded into page-backed Arrow layout blocks and streamed to the
worker over shared-memory transport; worker results return as Arrow pages and are
projected back into PostgreSQL tuple slots.

## Architecture

- `pg/extension/` - pgrx host extension, GUCs, planner/custom-scan hooks,
  shared-memory bootstrap, background worker entrypoint.
- `pg/backend_service/` - backend-side execution orchestration and scan page
  production.
- `worker_runtime/` - DataFusion worker runtime and transport-backed scan/result
  handling.
- `runtime_protocol/` - typed control-plane protocol for backend/worker runtime
  messages.
- `control_transport/` - shared-memory control rings and backend/worker leases.
- `page/pool/`, `page/transfer/`, `page/issuance/` - fixed-page ownership and
  page handoff infrastructure.
- `page/arrow_layout/`, `page/import/`, `pg/slot_encoder/`, `pg/slot_import/` -
  zero-copy Arrow page layout, PostgreSQL slot encoding, and result projection.
- `pg/plan_builder/`, `pg/df_catalog/`, `pg/scan_node/`, `pg/scan_sql/`,
  `pg/slot_scan/` - backend-side SQL planning and PostgreSQL scan execution.
- `pg/statistics/` - PostgreSQL planner/catalog statistics bridge used by
  costed join-order planning.
- `join_order/` - standalone compact join-order optimizer core used by
  DataFusion logical-plan reordering.
- `pg/test/` - pgrx integration tests for the active runtime path and
  page/slot pipeline.
- `lockfree/` - shared-memory lock-free primitives used by the transport/page
  stack.

## Build & Test

Workspace targets Rust 1.89.

```sh
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace \
  --exclude backend_service \
  --exclude df_catalog \
  --exclude pg_fusion \
  --exclude pg_statistics \
  --exclude pg_test \
  --exclude plan_builder \
  --exclude row_estimator_seed \
  --exclude slot_encoder \
  --exclude slot_import \
  --exclude slot_scan
```

PostgreSQL-bound crates are intentionally excluded from standalone
`cargo test`: they reference PostgreSQL backend symbols that only exist inside a
PostgreSQL backend. Their regression coverage lives in the pgrx test crates.
`pg_statistics` follows the same rule because it calls SPI and PostgreSQL
syscache APIs directly.

Build only the PostgreSQL extension crate:

```sh
cargo build -p pg_fusion
```

Format and lint:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --features "pg17, pg_test" --no-default-features
```

## pgrx Setup (PG 17)

Install and initialize pgrx:

```sh
cargo install cargo-pgrx
cargo pgrx init --pg17 $(which pg_config)
```

Configure `postgresql.conf` as described below before using the extension.

Run pgrx tests:

```sh
cargo pgrx test pg17 -p pg_fusion --features pg_test
cargo pgrx test pg17 -p pg_test
```

For the Postgres-side page pipeline benchmark under `pg_test`, see
[`pg/test/README.md`](pg/test/README.md).

## PostgreSQL Configuration

`pg_fusion` must be loaded by PostgreSQL at postmaster start because it
registers shared memory, hooks, and a background worker. For a pgrx PG 17 dev
cluster:

```sh
cat >> ~/.pgrx/data-17/postgresql.conf <<'EOF'
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_fusion'

# Worker/runtime diagnostics.
pg_fusion.worker_threads = 0
pg_fusion.log_path = '/tmp/pg_fusion.log'
pg_fusion.worker_log_filter = 'warn'

# Primary backend <-> worker control transport.
pg_fusion.control_slot_count = 64
pg_fusion.control_backend_to_worker_capacity = 8192
pg_fusion.control_worker_to_backend_capacity = 8192

# Dedicated scan control transport.
pg_fusion.scan_slot_count = 64
pg_fusion.scan_backend_to_worker_capacity = 256
pg_fusion.scan_worker_to_backend_capacity = 256

# Shared page pool and issued-page flow.
pg_fusion.page_size = 65536
pg_fusion.page_count = 256

# Backend PostgreSQL scan streaming.
pg_fusion.scan_fetch_batch_rows = 1024
pg_fusion.scan_batch_channel_capacity = 32
pg_fusion.scan_idle_poll_interval_us = 50
pg_fusion.estimator_initial_tail_bytes_per_row = 64

# Logical planning.
pg_fusion.join_reordering = on

# Runtime Bloom filters (enabled by default).
pg_fusion.runtime_filter_count = 64
pg_fusion.runtime_filter_bits = 1048576
pg_fusion.runtime_filter_hashes = 4
EOF
```

Most settings above are `Postmaster` GUCs and require a cluster restart after
changes. `pg_fusion.worker_threads = 0` lets the worker runtime choose its
thread count automatically. The scan ring capacities must stay at least `256`
bytes in each direction; the worker-to-backend scan ring carries `OpenScan`
messages that include the full scan producer set used by dynamic scan workers.
The issued-page permit pool is sized from `pg_fusion.page_count`, so each
shared page can have one outstanding issued handoff.

`pg_fusion.scan_batch_channel_capacity` and
`pg_fusion.scan_idle_poll_interval_us` are `Userset` GUCs despite being shown in
the sample config. The backend captures their current session values when a
query starts and sends them to the worker in `StartExecution`; changing them
mid-query does not affect already-open scan streams.

`pg_fusion.runtime_filter_enable` is also a `Userset` GUC and defaults to
`on`. The pool sizing knobs shown above are `Postmaster` GUCs because they
define shared-memory layout. By default, worker physical planning can build
Bloom filters for eligible inner hash joins and backend scan producers apply
ready filters before slot-to-Arrow encoding.

After configuring the pgrx cluster, install the extension and open `psql`:

```sh
cargo pgrx run pg17 -p pg_fusion
```

For a non-pgrx cluster, install the extension artifacts with that cluster's
`pg_config`, add `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_fusion'`, restart PostgreSQL,
and create the extension object in the target database:

```sh
cargo pgrx install -p pg_fusion --release --pg-config /path/to/pg_config
```

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_fusion;
```

Useful PostgreSQL planner/runtime knobs for scan experiments can be placed in
`postgresql.conf` or set per session with ordinary `SET` commands:

```conf
# Cursor planning bias used by PostgreSQL itself. Lower values favor fast-start
# plans; higher values favor total scan cost.
cursor_tuple_fraction = 0.1

# Normal PostgreSQL memory and parallel scan planning knobs. These are not
# pg_fusion settings, but they affect PostgreSQL plans that pg_fusion streams
# through slot_scan. pg_fusion also uses max_parallel_workers_per_gather as the
# query-wide budget for additional dynamic scan workers across eligible scan leaves.
work_mem = '64MB'
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2
min_parallel_table_scan_size = '8MB'
parallel_setup_cost = 1000
parallel_tuple_cost = 0.1
```

Treat these as workload-specific tuning inputs. `slot_scan` executes trusted
PostgreSQL scan SQL through PostgreSQL executor portals, so PostgreSQL's
ordinary planner settings still influence whether it chooses seq scan, index
scan, bitmap scan, or a parallel-capable plan.

## Runtime Use

Enable pg_fusion per session or transaction:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.enable = on;
```

For scoped experiments:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL pg_fusion.enable = on;
SELECT count(*) FROM my_table WHERE id > 100;
COMMIT;
```

Backend diagnostics can also be enabled without restarting:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.backend_log_level = 1; -- 0=off, 1=basic, 2=trace
```

Statistics-based join ordering is enabled by default:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.join_reordering = on;
```

When enabled, `plan_builder` uses PostgreSQL estimates, column statistics, and
relation-wide unique keys to reorder eligible inner/cross join components before
PostgreSQL scan leaves are lowered. It applies only to join trees whose leaves
are pg_fusion PostgreSQL table scans and whose join predicates are simple equi
column pairs; outer joins, residual join filters, unsupported expressions, and
subquery shapes remain in their DataFusion-planned order. Disable it for A/B
testing or to isolate planning issues:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.join_reordering = off;
```

Disable runtime filters for A/B testing or to isolate filter behavior:

```sql
SET pg_fusion.runtime_filter_enable = off;
```

The first implementation supports only simple `Column = Column` inner hash
joins with a single-partition build side, supported bool, integer, float, or
text-like keys, and a PostgreSQL scan on the probe side. If no slot is
available in the shared filter pool, the query continues without that filter
and increments `runtime_filter_pool_exhausted_total`.

`pg_fusion.scan_fetch_batch_rows` controls how many rows the backend asks
PostgreSQL to deliver from the scan portal per direct `PortalRunFetch()` call.
Rows are encoded from executor `TupleTableSlot`s directly into Arrow pages; no
SPI tuptable batch is materialized in the hot path. The default is `1024`; `0`
is not a valid configured value and the internal scan path normalizes only
defensive runtime inputs to at least one row. Page boundaries are handled by
the fetch row budget, not by pausing the PostgreSQL receiver mid-fetch. Scans
with variable-width transport columns use one-row drains so an overflowing row
can be retried on the next Arrow page without losing the scan position.

`pg_fusion.scan_batch_channel_capacity` controls the bounded channel between a
worker scan thread and the DataFusion stream consumer. The default is `32`,
which lets scan threads absorb short downstream polling gaps without retaining
unbounded Arrow batches. Lower values make backpressure visible sooner; very
large values can pin more page-backed batches before materialization operators
copy them.

`pg_fusion.scan_idle_poll_interval_us` controls how long a worker scan thread
sleeps when no dedicated scan frame is ready. The default is `50` microseconds.
Higher values reduce polling overhead but can add page handoff latency; lower
values are useful when `scan_idle_sleep_ns` dominates metrics.

`max_parallel_workers_per_gather` controls the query-wide budget for dynamic
PostgreSQL scan workers across eligible pg_fusion leaf scans. `0` keeps scans
leader-only. A positive value allows up to that many additional dynamic
background-worker producers for the whole pg_fusion query, capped at `32` and
bounded by `max_worker_processes` headroom. Eligible scans share the budget; the
leader backend and workers each scan disjoint heap block ranges and write Arrow
pages into the same shared page pool. The path is used for cross-backend-visible
heap relations that can be read as unprojected base relation slots without
dropped attributes. Other scans use leader-only portal streaming. If dynamic
worker capacity is exhausted at runtime, pg_fusion falls back to leader-only
streaming for the affected and remaining scans instead of failing the query.

DataFusion fetch/limit hints are lowered into `slot_scan` as a PostgreSQL
fast-start planning hint plus a local soft row cap. They are not documented as
an exact global SQL `LIMIT` guarantee; exact SQL limit semantics must remain in
the logical query plan above the scan path.

## Runtime Metrics

`pg_fusion` exposes cumulative runtime counters from shared memory:

```sql
SELECT pg_fusion_metrics_reset();

SET pg_fusion.enable = on;
SELECT count(*) FROM my_table WHERE id > 100;

SELECT component, metric, kind, unit, value, reset_epoch
FROM pg_fusion_metrics()
WHERE value <> 0
ORDER BY component, metric;
```

`pg_fusion_metrics()` returns a relational result, not JSON. This keeps psql,
SQL filtering, and external collectors simple; JSON can be derived with
`jsonb_object_agg()` if needed. `pg_fusion_metrics_reset()` clears the runtime
counters and advances `reset_epoch`. In-flight page handoff stamps from an older
epoch are ignored after reset.

Metric names use a simple convention:

- `*_ns` is accumulated time in nanoseconds.
- `*_total` is an event count or cumulative counter.
- `*_bytes_sent_total` is the payload bytes written into shared page slots.

Useful latency probes:

```sql
SELECT
  sum(value) FILTER (WHERE metric = 'backend_wait_latch_ns')::numeric
  / nullif(sum(value) FILTER (WHERE metric = 'backend_wait_latch_total'), 0)
    AS avg_backend_wait_latch_ns
FROM pg_fusion_metrics();

SELECT *
FROM pg_fusion_metrics()
WHERE metric IN (
  'scan_page_fill_ns',
  'scan_page_prepare_ns',
  'scan_page_finish_ns',
  'scan_page_retry_total',
  'scan_fetch_calls_total',
  'scan_rows_encoded_total',
  'scan_full_pages_total',
  'scan_eof_pages_total',
  'scan_b2w_wait_ns',
  'scan_page_read_ns',
  'scan_batch_send_ns',
  'scan_batch_delivery_ns',
  'scan_idle_sleep_ns',
  'result_w2b_wait_ns',
  'query_total_ns',
  'backend_total_ns',
  'worker_total_ns'
)
ORDER BY component, metric;
```

The scan/result "slot" metrics refer to shared page-pool slots used for Arrow
pages, not PostgreSQL `TupleTableSlot`. Backend and worker timings may overlap,
so `backend_total_ns + worker_total_ns` is not expected to equal
`query_total_ns`.

To inspect backend scan latency, reset the metrics, run the query, then read the
always-on scan metrics:

```sql
SELECT pg_fusion_metrics_reset();
SET pg_fusion.enable = on;

SELECT a FROM t2 WHERE a = 1;

SELECT metric, value
FROM pg_fusion_metrics()
WHERE metric LIKE 'scan_%'
ORDER BY metric;
```

Scan timing metrics are intentionally coarse and cheap enough to remain always
enabled. They do not instrument slot-to-Arrow internals; use a flamegraph or
profiler for tuple deformation, detoast, and page-write attribution.

Interpretation:

- `scan_page_fill_ns` is the coarse backend page-fill timer for successful scan
  pages. It includes PostgreSQL cursor/slot drain, tuple encoding, Arrow page
  writes, page layout, and estimator work.
- `scan_page_prepare_ns` and `scan_page_finish_ns` split the cheap setup/finalize
  portions of emitted scan pages.
- `scan_page_retry_total` counts estimator retry/backoff attempts that did not
  emit a page.
- `scan_eof_pages_total = 1` with one returned row means the scan emitted a
  partial page only after PostgreSQL reached EOF.
- `scan_b2w_wait_ns` is backend stamp to worker scan-thread frame read.
  Compare it with `scan_idle_sleep_ns` to identify idle polling/scheduling.
- `scan_batch_send_ns` is time blocked inside the DataFusion scan channel send;
  high values point at downstream DataFusion backpressure.
- `scan_batch_delivery_ns` is frame read to accepted DataFusion batch; subtract
  `scan_batch_send_ns` to approximate worker-local page decode/import overhead.

## Developer Guidelines

- Rust 2021; keep changes small and focused; avoid panics in extension paths.
- Before PR: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, standalone tests with
  PostgreSQL-bound crates excluded, and the relevant pgrx tests.
- Commit style: `area: concise change`.
